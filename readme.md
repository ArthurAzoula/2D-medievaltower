# Medieval Tower

In a realm known as Rue Royale, a great tower, a testament to the medieval era, stood tall and imposing. The Rue Royale
Tower was a mystical structure, each floor of which was veiled in enigmatic themes and stories, each level telling a
different chapter from which no one had ever returned alive.

At the heart of this intrigue was Maxime de Paix-Dieu, a valiant young knight destined to make his mark on the kingdom's
history. As a child, he was revered as the chosen hero, destined to prove himself and win the heart of King Olivier de
Berliner's beloved daughter. Maxime's quest begins under the king's watchful eye, on his 18th birthday. This is where
our story begins, at the foot of the tower.
